- [x] Snapshot import < 5 min (PASSED)
- [ ] 11 other criteria (BLOCKED, FAILED, or UNKNOWN)

### 6 Issues Identified

## Component Status

| Component | Completeness | Status | Issues |
|-----------|--------------|--------|--------|
| Storage Layer | 95% | ✓ Complete | None |
| Merkle Tree | 90% | ✓ Complete | None |
| Snapshots | 85% | ⚠ Missing compression | Compression only |
| Ledger | 85% | ⚠ Performance issue | O(n²) recompute |
| Scheduler | 95% | ✓ Complete | Untested perf |
| WASM Runtime | 15% | ✗ CRITICAL | Not implemented |
| Host Functions | 40% | ⚠ Placeholders | Hardcoded values |

---

## Critical Issues

### 1. WASM Runtime (CRITICAL - Blocks Everything)

**Location**: `crates/runtime/src/vm.rs:85-96`

**Problem**:
```rust
// In production: use Wasmtime
// let engine = Engine::new(&config)?;  // COMMENTED OUT!
// ...
// For now: simplified execution
let result = self.execute_simplified(wasm_bytes, context, input)?;
```

**Impact**: Cannot execute smart contracts → consensus broken

**Fix**: 2-3 days (Implement full Wasmtime integration)

---

### 2. Snapshot Compression (HIGH - Fails Spec)

**Location**: `crates/state/snapshots/src/compression.rs`

**Problem**:
```rust
pub fn compress(bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u8>> {
    Ok(bytes.to_vec())  // NO-OP! Just copies!
}
```

**Impact**: No compression (1x vs 10x spec requirement)

**Fix**: 1 day (Add zstd compression)

---

### 3. Host Functions (MEDIUM - Wrong Context)

**Location**: `crates/runtime/src/host_functions.rs:108-133`

**Problem**:
```rust
pub fn block_number(&mut self) -> Result<u64> {
    Ok(1000)  // HARDCODED!
}

pub fn timestamp(&mut self) -> Result<u64> {
    Ok(1234567890)  // HARDCODED!
}
```

**Impact**: Contracts get wrong block context

**Fix**: 1 day (Pass ExecutionContext to HostFunctions)

---

## Robustness Assessment

### Error Handling: GOOD
- 28+ error handling points identified
- Proper use of `bail!()` and `Err()`

### Panic Points: CONCERNING
- 20+ `.unwrap()` calls identified
- Could panic under edge cases
- Recommendation: Use `?` operator instead

### Edge Cases: PARTIALLY TESTED
- ✓ Empty state
- ✓ Single account
- ✗ Large state (1M+) - not tested
- ✗ Concurrent access - not verified
- ✗ Out-of-memory - not handled
- ✗ Snapshot corruption - no recovery
- ✗ Determinism - not verified

### Stress Testing: NOT DONE
- No large state test
- No concurrent ops test
- No OOM test

---

## Timeline to Production Ready

### Critical Path (Sequential)
```
Week 1:
- Days 1-3: Implement WASM runtime (CRITICAL)
- Day 4: Fix host functions
- Days 5-6: Verify state determinism
```

### Parallel Work (Same Timeline)
```
- Compression: 1 day
- Merkle optimization: 2-3 days
- Integration tests: 3-4 days
- Performance validation: 2 days
```

### Total: 14-19 days to production-ready

---

## Recommendations

### IMMEDIATE (THIS WEEK)
1. ✓ Start WASM runtime implementation (CRITICAL)
2. ✓ Fix host functions context
3. ✓ Add determinism verification tests

### NEXT WEEK  
4. ✓ Implement compression
5. ✓ Optimize Merkle tree
6. ✓ Add 10-15 integration tests

### WEEK 3
7. ✓ Performance benchmarking
8. ✓ Final validation

### BLOCKERS FOR PHASE 3
- DO NOT proceed to Phase 3 until:
  - ✓ WASM runtime fully implemented
  - ✓ Host functions return correct context
  - ✓ State determinism verified
  - ✓ All 12 acceptance criteria met
  - ✓ Integration tests passing
  - ✓ Performance validated

## Test Coverage

| Component | Unit Tests | Coverage | Integration |
|-----------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Storage | 2 | ~80% | None |
| Merkle | 3 | ~70% | None |
| Ledger | 3 | ~75% | None |
| Runtime | 11 | ~65% | None (BLOCKED on WASM) |
| **TOTAL** | **28** | **~70%** | **MISSING** |

**Gap**: 0 integration tests (snapshot roundtrip, WASM execution, concurrency, stress tests)

---

## Code Metrics

- **Total LOC**: 1,894
- **Error handling points**: 28+
- **Potential panic points**: 20+
- **Unit test ratio**: 28 tests / 1,894 LOC = 1.5%
- **Integration test ratio**: 0%

## E2E Robustness Checklist

Before marking Phase 2 production-ready:

```
WASM Runtime:
[ ] Bytecode compilation works
[ ] Gas metering accurate
[ ] Execution deterministic
[ ] OOM errors handled
[ ] Contract state persisted

Host Functions:
[ ] Correct block_number returned
[ ] Correct timestamp returned
[ ] Correct caller identified
[ ] All context functions working

Snapshots:
[ ] Compression > 10x ratio
[ ] Generation < 2 min (50GB)
[ ] Import < 5 min (50GB)
[ ] Roundtrip preserves state
[ ] Corruption detection works

Ledger:
[ ] Transactions applied correctly
[ ] State root deterministic
[ ] Merkle tree correct
[ ] Concurrent ops safe
[ ] Large state (1M+) works

Performance:
[ ] Read latency < 1ms
[ ] Write latency < 10ms
[ ] No panics under load
[ ] Resource usage OK

Testing:
[ ] All unit tests pass
[ ] All integration tests pass
[ ] No unhandled errors
[ ] Stress tests pass
[ ] Cross-node verification passes
```

---

## Conclusion

**Phase 2 is NOT ready for production**. While 55-60% of code is complete and largely correct, critical gaps in WASM runtime, compression, and integration tests prevent deployment.

**Recommendation**: Allocate 2-3 week sprint to implement critical fixes and add comprehensive integration tests. Only then proceed to Phase 3.

**Next Step**: Begin WASM runtime implementation immediately.
