## Branch Strategy

Each major component gets its own branch:
- `phase1/component-name` - Phase 1 features
- `phase2/component-name` - Phase 2 features
- etc.

Branches merge to `main` after completion.

## Commit Message Format

```
feat(scope): description
fix(scope): description
docs(scope): description
test(scope): description
```

Scopes: crypto, consensus, ledger, runtime, networking, rpc, programs, ai-mesh, etc.

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests for system interactions
- Property tests for invariants
- Benchmarks for performance-critical paths

## Current Branches

- `main` - Stable integrated code
- `phase1/ed25519-verification` - âœ… Merged
- `phase1/json-rpc-server` - âœ… Merged
- `phase1/ecvrf-leader-election` - ðŸ”„ In Progress

## Next 5 Priorities

1. **ECVRF leader election** - Fair randomness for consensus
2. **BLS aggregation** - Efficient vote compression
3. **HotStuff consensus** - Full BFT with 2-phase voting
4. **WASM runtime** - Smart contract execution
5. **Parallel scheduler** - Utilize R/W sets for concurrency

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- [ ] VRF-PoS leader selection working
- [ ] BLS vote aggregation functional
- [ ] HotStuff 2-chain finality implemented
- [ ] WASM VM executing contracts
- [ ] Parallel scheduler showing 2.5x+ speedup
- [ ] Basic P2P gossip working
- [ ] 4-node devnet running
- [ ] JSON-RPC serving requests

### Phase 2 Complete When:
- [ ] Staking bond/unbond working
- [ ] Governance proposals functional
- [ ] AMM swaps executing
- [ ] AIC mint/burn working
- [ ] Job escrow end-to-end demo
- [ ] Fee markets operational
- [ ] State rent implemented
