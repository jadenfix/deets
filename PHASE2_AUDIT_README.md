# Phase 2 Comprehensive Audit Plan - Complete Documentation

## Overview

This is a **complete, step-by-step plan** to audit Phase 2 (State & Runtime) implementation across the entire Aether codebase. The audit is designed to:

1. **Identify what's implemented** (inventory)
2. **Verify what works** (testing)
3. **Find gaps and issues** (analysis)
4. **Measure completeness** (metrics)
5. **Plan remediation** (action items)

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Why is Phase 2 only 55-60% complete when progress.md says it's complete?**  
A: progress.md shows *what was delivered* but not *what works*. WASM runtime is stubbed out, compression is pass-through, and host functions use placeholders.

**Q: What's the critical path to fix?**  
A: WASM runtime (2-3 days) + host functions (1 day) + determinism verification (2 days) = 5-6 days minimum.

**Q: Can Phase 3 start before Phase 2 is done?**  
A: No. Phase 2 provides runtime infrastructure that Phase 3 depends on. WASM runtime MUST be implemented first.

**Q: Which issue should we fix first?**  
A: WASM runtime (CRITICAL). It blocks everything else and takes longest.

**Q: Are the unit tests good enough?**  
A: No. 70-85% coverage is okay, but 0 integration tests is a gap. Need snapshot roundtrip, WASM execution, and determinism tests.

**Q: How confident is the timeline estimate?**  
A: High confidence. Estimates based on code complexity, test coverage, and dependency analysis. WASM is unknown risk due to Wasmtime complexity.
