# Phase 2 Audit Summary - Executive Report

**Audit Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Scope**: State & Runtime Components (crates/state/*, crates/ledger/*, crates/runtime/*)  
**Status**: INCOMPLETE - Critical gaps identified  

---

## Overview

Phase 2 implementation is **50-60% complete** with **3 critical issues blocking production readiness**.

| Component | Status | Completeness |
|-----------|--------|--------------|
| Storage Layer | ✓ Complete | 95% |
| Merkle Tree | ✓ Complete | 90% |
| Snapshots Gen/Import | ✓ Complete | 85% |
| Ledger State | ✓ Complete | 85% |
| WASM Runtime | ✗ Incomplete | 15% |
| Host Functions | ⚠ Partial | 40% |
| Compression | ✗ Not Done | 0% |
| **Overall** | | **~55%** |

---

## Critical Issues (MUST FIX)

### 1. WASM Runtime Not Implemented
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Location**: `crates/runtime/src/vm.rs:85-96`  
**Impact**: Cannot execute smart contracts at all  

**Current State**:
- Wasmtime integration is commented out
- execute_simplified() is a stub that always returns success
- No actual WASM bytecode execution
- Gas metering not applied

**Required Fix**:
```
1. Uncomment and implement Engine::new()
2. Implement Module::new() with bytecode validation
3. Add Store with fuel metering
4. Implement actual execute() with memory/stack limits
5. Add comprehensive test coverage
```

**Effort**: 2-3 days | **Risk**: HIGH

---

### 2. Snapshot Compression Missing
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Location**: `crates/state/snapshots/src/compression.rs`  
**Impact**: Snapshots not compressed, defeating performance goal  

**Current State**:
```rust
pub fn compress(bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<Vec<u8>> {
    Ok(bytes.to_vec())  // Just copies!
}
```

**Spec Requires**: 99.9% compression (50GB → 500MB), currently 1x (no compression)

**Required Fix**:
- Implement zstd or snappy compression
- Add performance benchmarks
- Verify compression ratio > 10x

**Effort**: 1 day | **Risk**: MEDIUM

---

### 3. Host Functions Use Hardcoded Placeholders
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Location**: `crates/runtime/src/host_functions.rs:108-133`  
**Impact**: Contracts get wrong block context  

**Current State**:
```rust
pub fn block_number(&mut self) -> Result<u64> {
    Ok(1000)  // HARDCODED!
}
pub fn timestamp(&mut self) -> Result<u64> {
    Ok(1234567890)  // HARDCODED!
}
```

**Required Fix**:
- Pass ExecutionContext to HostFunctions
- Store actual block_number, timestamp, caller
- Remove all placeholder values

**Effort**: 1 day | **Risk**: LOW

---

## Medium-Priority Issues

### 4. Ledger Merkle Recompute is O(n²)
**Location**: `crates/ledger/src/state.rs:170-195`  
**Issue**: Rebuilds entire tree on every transaction  
**Impact**: Performance degrades with state size  
**Fix Effort**: 2-3 days  

### 5. Missing Integration Tests
**Issues**: 
- No snapshot roundtrip test
- No WASM contract execution test (blocked on WASM)
- No concurrent ledger test
- No large state (1M+ accounts) test

**Fix Effort**: 3-4 days

### 6. State Root Determinism Unverified
**Issue**: Claimed deterministic but no cross-node verification  
**Fix Effort**: 2 days

---

## What's Working Well

- **Storage Layer** (RocksDB wrapper, column families)
- **Merkle Tree** (sparse implementation with SHA256)
- **Ledger** (account operations, transaction validation)
- **Snapshot Gen/Import** (state export/restore works)
- **Parallel Scheduler** (conflict detection complete)
- **Unit Tests** (70-85% coverage across components)

---

## Quantified Impact

### Components Fully Implemented
```
✓ RocksDB storage + 6 column families
✓ Sparse Merkle tree with proofs
✓ State persistence and batching
✓ Account model with nonce tracking
✓ UTxO consumption/creation
✓ Transaction signature verification
✓ Batch signature verification
✓ Parallel scheduler + conflict detection
```

### Components Missing/Broken
```
✗ WASM VM execution (critical)
✗ Snapshot compression (high)
✗ Host function context (medium)
⚠ Merkle optimization (medium)
⚠ Integration tests (medium)
⚠ Determinism verification (medium)
```

## Production Readiness Checklist

Phase 2 acceptance criteria from spec:
```
Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] WASM contracts execute deterministically (BLOCKED)
- [ ] Gas metering accurate to within 1% (BLOCKED)
- [ ] State root deterministic across nodes (UNKNOWN)
- [ ] Snapshots compress to > 10x (FAILED - 1x currently)
- [ ] Snapshot gen < 2 min (50GB) (UNKNOWN)
- [ ] Snapshot import < 5 min (PASSED - 2s for 2k accts)
- [ ] Scheduler shows 3x+ speedup (UNTESTED)
