================================================================================
                        CRITICAL FINDINGS
================================================================================

ISSUE 1: WASM Runtime Not Implemented
  Severity: CRITICAL
  Location: crates/runtime/src/vm.rs:85-96
  Status: Stub only (15% complete)
  Impact: Cannot execute smart contracts, consensus broken
  Evidence:
    - Wasmtime Engine creation commented out
    - execute_simplified() returns mock success
    - No actual bytecode execution
    - No gas metering applied
  Fix Timeline: 2-3 days
  Risk: HIGH (Wasmtime complexity)
  Blocks: Phase 3, all contract execution, protocol operation

ISSUE 2: Snapshot Compression Not Implemented
  Severity: HIGH
  Location: crates/state/snapshots/src/compression.rs
  Status: Pass-through (0% complete)
  Impact: Snapshots not compressed, defeats specification
  Evidence:
    - compress() = Ok(bytes.to_vec())
    - decompress() = Ok(bytes.to_vec())
    - Spec requires 10x compression (50GB → 5GB)
    - Current: 1x (no compression)
  Fix Timeline: 1 day
  Risk: LOW (straightforward)
  Fails: Acceptance criterion "compress > 10x"

ISSUE 3: Host Functions Use Hardcoded Placeholders
  Severity: MEDIUM
  Location: crates/runtime/src/host_functions.rs:108-133
  Status: Partially implemented (40%)
  Impact: Contracts get wrong block context
  Evidence:
    - block_number() returns 1000
    - timestamp() returns 1234567890
    - caller() returns Address::from_slice(&[1u8; 20])
    - address() returns Address::from_slice(&[2u8; 20])
  Fix Timeline: 1 day
  Risk: LOW
  Impact: Wrong context to all contracts

ISSUE 4: Merkle Tree O(n²) Performance
  Severity: MEDIUM
  Location: crates/ledger/src/state.rs:170-195
  Status: Needs optimization
  Impact: Performance degrades with state size
  Evidence:
    - recompute_state_root() rebuilds entire tree
    - Full account scan per transaction
    - O(n) per tx = O(n²) per block
  Fix Timeline: 2-3 days
  Risk: MEDIUM (correctness must be preserved)
  Impact: Throughput limited by state size

ISSUE 5: No Integration Tests
  Severity: MEDIUM
  Location: Missing tests
  Status: 0% (not implemented)
  Impact: Unknown correctness
  Evidence:
    - No snapshot roundtrip test
    - No WASM execution test
    - No concurrent operations test
    - No large state stress test
    - No determinism verification
  Fix Timeline: 3-4 days
  Risk: MEDIUM
  Missing: 10-15 critical integration tests

ISSUE 6: State Root Determinism Unverified
  Severity: MEDIUM
  Location: No test exists
  Status: Claimed but unverified
  Impact: Consensus risk if not truly deterministic
  Evidence:
    - No property tests
    - No cross-node verification
    - No different-ordering tests
    - No serialization spec
  Fix Timeline: 2 days
  Risk: MEDIUM (important for consensus)
  Impact: Could cause fork under certain conditions

================================================================================
                        AUDIT CONCLUSION
================================================================================

PRODUCTION READINESS: NOT READY

Phase 2 is approximately 55-60% complete with critical gaps blocking 
production deployment.

MUST FIX BEFORE PRODUCTION:
  1. WASM Runtime (CRITICAL) - 0% production ready
  2. Host Functions (MEDIUM) - Wrong context
  3. State Determinism (MEDIUM) - Not verified
  4. Snapshot Compression (HIGH) - Fails spec
  5. Integration Tests (MEDIUM) - No E2E validation
  6. Merkle Optimization (MEDIUM) - Performance issue

RECOMMENDATION: Allocate 2-3 week sprint to complete Phase 2 properly.

DO NOT PROCEED TO PHASE 3 UNTIL:
  - WASM runtime is fully implemented and tested
  - Host functions return correct context
  - State root determinism is verified
  - All 12 acceptance criteria met
  - Integration tests pass
  - Performance benchmarks validated

NEXT STEP: Begin WASM runtime implementation immediately.
