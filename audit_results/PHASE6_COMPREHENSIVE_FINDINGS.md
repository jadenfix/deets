## CRITICAL ISSUES RANKED BY SEVERITY

### SEVERITY: CRITICAL

**Issue: WASM Runtime Not Implemented**
- Blocks: Everything related to smart contracts
- Status: Stub only (15% of necessary code)
- Impact: HIGH - Cannot run contracts, consensus broken
- Fix: 2-3 days
- Testing: Requires comprehensive test suite

**Why it's critical:**
- Phase 2 is titled "State & Runtime"
- WASM runtime is 50% of Phase 2 requirements
- All Phase 3 depends on this
- Acceptance criteria: WASM execution deterministically

---

### SEVERITY: HIGH

**Issue: Snapshot Compression Not Implemented**
- Blocks: Snapshot performance spec
- Status: Pass-through (0% implementation)
- Impact: MEDIUM - Fails spec but not blocking
- Fix: 1 day
- Testing: Compression ratio benchmarks

**Why it matters:**
- Spec requires 10x compression (50GB → 5GB)
- Currently 1x (50GB → 50GB)
- Storage bloat defeats snapshot purpose
- Acceptance criterion: "Snapshots compress > 10x"

---

### SEVERITY: MEDIUM

**Issue 1: Host Functions Use Placeholders**
- Impact: Contracts get wrong context
- Fix: 1 day
- Testing: Unit tests for context passing

**Issue 2: Merkle Tree Optimization Needed**
- Impact: O(n²) performance per block
- Fix: 2-3 days
- Testing: Performance benchmarks

**Issue 3: Missing Integration Tests**
- Impact: Unknown correctness
- Fix: 3-4 days
- Testing: 10-15 new integration tests

**Issue 4: State Root Determinism Unverified**
- Impact: Consensus risk
- Fix: 2 days
- Testing: Property tests + cross-node verification

---

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA SCORECARD

| Criterion | Status | Evidence | Pass |
|-----------|--------|----------|------|
| WASM contracts deterministic | BLOCKED | VM not implemented | ✗ |
| Gas metering accurate to 1% | BLOCKED | Host functions need context | ✗ |
| State root deterministic nodes | UNKNOWN | No cross-node test | ✗ |
| Snapshots compress > 10x | FAILED | Currently 1x | ✗ |
| Snapshot gen < 2 min (50GB) | UNKNOWN | Not benchmarked | ✗ |
| Snapshot import < 5 min | PASSED | 2s for 2k accounts | ✓ |
| Scheduler 3x+ speedup | UNKNOWN | Not benchmarked | ✗ |
| 100% unit test coverage | 70-85% | Some gaps remain | ✗ |
| Integration tests pass | MISSING | No integration tests | ✗ |
| Performance benchmarks met | UNKNOWN | Baselines not set | ✗ |
| Zero unhandled panics | UNKNOWN | No stress test | ✗ |
| Cross-node verification | MISSING | Not implemented | ✗ |
