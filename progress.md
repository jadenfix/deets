# Aether Progress & Integration Status

## Summary

Phase 1 is complete and the Phase 2 implementation is now feature-complete. Ledger-backed runtime execution, snapshot round-trips, batch signature verification, and deterministic WASM execution all land in this branch. The outstanding TODOs from the earlier audit (tests, documentation, acceptance harness) are now closed, so we can shift attention to Phase 3 planning once review/PR wraps up.

## Current Status

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Phase 1 – Core Consensus & Ledger | ✅ Complete | Hybrid consensus scaffolding, ledger core, runtime abstractions, quick-check script |
| Phase 2 – State & Runtime Integration | ✅ Code complete | Ledger runtime state, chain store, snapshots, determinism tests, CLI smoke |
| Phase 3 – Programs & Economics | ⏳ Not started | Ready to scope once Phase 2 merges |
| Phase 4 – Networking & DA | ⏳ Not started | Pending roadmap resync |
| Phase 5 – Observability | ⏳ Not started | Pending roadmap resync |
| Phase 6 – Security | ⏳ Not started | Pending roadmap resync |
| Phase 7 – Developer Platform | ⏳ Not started | Pending roadmap resync |

## Phase 2 Highlights (now in-tree)

- **LedgerRuntimeState** (`crates/runtime/src/ledger_state.rs`) commits contract storage, balances, and logs atomically onto the ledger.
- **ChainStore** (`crates/ledger/src/chain_store.rs`) persists blocks + receipts and backs the new integration tests.
- **Sparse snapshot pipeline** (`crates/state/snapshots`) now round-trips ledger state into fresh storage instances.
- **Determinism coverage** (`tests/determinism_test.rs`) guards ledger ordering and WASM gas invariants.
- **End-to-end integration** (`tests/phase2_integration.rs`) exercises ledger, runtime, snapshots, and chain store together.
- **CLI smoke** (`crates/tools/cli/tests/cli_smoke.rs`) checks key generation, transfers, job posting, and staking helpers.

## Acceptance & Regression Tests

Run the consolidated acceptance harness:

```bash
./scripts/phase2_acceptance_test.sh
```

This script performs:

- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- Workspace build
- Targeted crate test suites (`aether-runtime`, `aether-ledger`, `aether-state-snapshots`, `aether-state-storage`)
- Cross-crate integration regression (`cargo test --test phase2_integration`)
- Determinism checks (`cargo test --test determinism_test`)
- CLI smoke coverage (`cargo test -p aether-cli transfer_and_job_flow -- --exact`)

All of the above pass on `phase2/pr-ready` as of 2025-10-17.

## Next Steps

1. Land the Phase 2 PR (branch prep detailed here and in `README.md`).
2. Lock in scope for Phase 3 (program logic, fee markets, staking economics).
3. Extend automation: add a CI job that invokes `scripts/phase2_acceptance_test.sh`.
